# AeroPal
Objective:- To help users have a smooth transitioning experience inside airports.

Implementation:- AeroPal aims at providing well-routed maps with proper steps to users based on his/her flight details and the airport.

Application:- This idea could help several people, complete the complex airport processes with ease.

Final result: A fast, and dynamic website, which is built with motto, of simplifying airports for every single individual, so that they never miss their flight.

Future Goal:- We plan on building the entire website from scratch, make it responsive and user friendly. We also intend to add multiple new features like more detailed maps using dynamic routing. A mobile-application could also be developed, to make it more accessible, speedy, compatible and customizable.
